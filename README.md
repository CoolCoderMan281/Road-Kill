# Need something added?
 Create a new issue in the issues tab at the top, and then describe what you need.

# Finding builds
 All builds can be found on the releases tab to the right. Download the version
 you want, and unzip the file. Then run the game normally.

# Downloading source
 To get the source easily you should install GitHub Desktop.
 You can find that at desktop.github.com.
 Once installed click clone repository, and select this one,
 then do everything github prompts you to do. Remeber where you
 set the save location on your computer.

# Importing source
 Open unity hub, from there select where you cloned the repository,
 then unity will open like normal, I recommend installing the unity version
 the project was made with rather than upgrading the project.

# Saving your changes to github
 In the bottom left of github desktop, write a simple summary of what you did
 and then press the commit button, then at the top select push origin.
